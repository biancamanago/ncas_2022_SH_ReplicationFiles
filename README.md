## Experimental Replication Files
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the experimental replication files for the manuscript.

### <i>Experiment 1</i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experiment 1 was conducted in zTree and you can access those files for all conditions [here](https://github.com/biancamanago/mtc_2022_SSR_replication-files/blob/94b2681d0e2a531bb1d714b11242dc276a7f439c/ztree.zip). <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experimental conditions are listed in the file names, see below for naming conventions. 


### <i>Experiment 2</i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experiment 2 was conducted on qualtrics. The [.qsf file](https://github.com/biancamanago/mtc_2022_SSR_replication-files/blob/125698aa203e18104ac4ee5d22f7a08eabb91f29/mtc-E2-SSR_Replication.qsf) allows you to conduct the same study without any additional programming.
